Bindings to the reference [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2)
implementation.

**Want to use it on command line? Instead check
[node-argon2-cli](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2-cli).**

### Usage
It's possible to hash a password using both Argon2i (default) Argon2d and Argon2id, sync
and async, and to verify if a password matches a hash.

To hash a password:
```js
const argon2 = require('argon2');

argon2.hash('password').then(hash => {
  // ...
}).catch(err => {
  // ...
});

// ES7 or TypeScript

try {
  const hash = await argon2.hash("password");
} catch (err) {
  //...
}
```
You can choose between Argon2i, Argon2d and Argon2id by passing an object as the third
argument with the `type` key set to which type you want to use:
```js
argon2.hash('password', {
  type: argon2.argon2d
}).then(hash => {
  // ...
}).catch(err => {
  // internal failure
});

// ES7 or TypeScript

try {
  const hash = await argon2.hash('password', {
    type: argon2.argon2d
  });
} catch (err) {
  // internal failure
}
```
The `type` option is flexible and accepts 0, 1 or 2 for Argon2d, Argon2i and Argon2id respectively.

You can also get the hash as a raw Node Buffer by passing 'true' to the 'raw' option:

```js
argon2.hash('password', {
  raw: true
}).then(hash => {
  // ... hash is a Buffer
}).catch(err => {
  // internal failure
});

// ES7 or TypeScript

try {
  const hash = await argon2.hash('password', {
    raw: true
  });
} catch (err) {
  // internal failure
}
```

You can change the Promise with
[any-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/any-promise). Try using Bluebird or
Q for enhanced functionality.

You can also modify time, memory and parallelism constraints passing the object
as the third parameter, with keys `timeCost`, `memoryCost` and `parallelism`,
respectively defaulted to 3, 12 (meaning 2^12 KB) and 1 (threads):
```js
const options = {
  timeCost: 4, memoryCost: 13, parallelism: 2, type: argon2.argon2d
};

argon2.hash('password', options).then(hash => {
  // ...
});

// ES7 or TypeScript

const hash = await argon2.hash("password", options);
```

The default parameters for Argon2 can be accessed with `defaults`:
```js
console.log(argon2.defaults);
// => { timeCost: 3, memoryCost: 12, parallelism: 1, type: argon2.argon2i }
```

To verify a password:
```js
argon2.verify('<big long hash>', 'password').then(match => {
  if (match) {
    // password match
  } else {
    // password did not match
  }
}).catch(err => {
  // internal failure
});

// ES7 or TypeScript

try {
  if (await argon2.verify("<big long hash>", "password")) {
    // password match
  } else {
    // password did not match
  }
} catch (err) {
  // internal failure
}
```
First parameter must have been generated by an Argon2 encoded hashing method,
not raw.

When you hit an internal failure, the message is properly set. If it is not or
you do not understand it, feel free to open an issue.

### TypeScript Usage
A TypeScript type declaration file is published with this module. If you are
using TypeScript >= 2.0.0 that means you do not need to install any additional
typings in order to get access to the strongly typed interface. Simply use the
library as mentioned above. This library uses Promises, so make sure you are
targeting ES6+, including the es2015.promise lib in your build, or globally
importing a Promise typings library.

Some example tsconfig.json compiler options:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": ["es2015.promise"]
    }
}

or

{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6"
    }
}
```

```ts
import * as argon2 from "argon2";

const hash = await argon2.hash(..);
```

### Differences from [node-argon2-ffi](https://github.com/cjlarose/argon2-ffi)
This library is implemented natively, meaning it is an extension to the node
engine. Thus, half of the code are C++ bindings, the other half are Javascript
functions. node-argon2-ffi uses ffi, a mechanism to call functions from one
language in another, and handles the type bindings (e.g. JS Number -> C++ int).

The interface of both are very similar, notably node-argon2-ffi splits the
argon2i and argon2d function set, but this module also has the argon2id option. Also, while
node-argon2-ffi suggests you promisify `crypto.randomBytes, this library does that internally.

Performance-wise, the libraries are equal. You can run the same benchmark suite
if you are curious, but both can perform around 130 hashes/second on an Intel
Core i5-4460 @ 3.2GHz with default options.

### Before installing
You **MUST** have a **node-gyp** global install before proceeding with install,
along with GCC >= 4.8 / Clang >= 3.3. On Windows, you must compile under Visual
Studio 2015 or newer.

**node-argon2** works only and is tested against Node >=4.0.0.

#### OSX

To install GCC >= 4.8 on OSX, use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```console
$ brew install gcc
```

Once you've got GCC installed and ready to run, you then need to install
node-gyp, you must do this globally:
```console
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

Finally, once node-gyp is installed and ready to go, you can install this
library, specifying the GCC or Clang binary to use:

```console
$ CXX=g++-6 npm install argon2
```

**NOTE**: If your GCC or Clang binary is named something different than `g++-6`,
you'll need to specify that in the command.
